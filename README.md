2D game - Siyun(Sherry) Lyu

Story: 

  There is a girl who owns a farm, a guitar and all those cute animals, like cow, chickens, 
  pigs, sheep, and horses. But always there	is a bad character in the story, in my case is 
  a group of birds (actually blue dragons). They will try to catch those cute animals and 
  girl will always defense by using her guitar. There are about 5 of them (for demo, can 
  change in XML), and she will need to hit or jump and hit them before any of them totally 
  catch away those cute animals. If she can kill all the birds before they catch all the animals, 
  she will be treat as successfully protect this farm, otherwise she lose them all.
